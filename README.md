## Abstract

Multiple studies have shown that a Working-Zone approach can lower the power consumption of Micropro- cessors Address Buses [1][2]. This project focuses on implementing such technique on an FPGA, providing a design that works properly during pre-synthesis and post-synthesis while keeping the code as simple as possible for future developments.
